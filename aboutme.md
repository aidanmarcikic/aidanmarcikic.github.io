*Me hiking in Goblin Valley, Utah in the Summer of 2023*

In my work, I aim to understand how we can better bolster progressive social movements by using experiemental methods in psychology.

Outside of my work, I am the Co-Chair of my Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter @ ILSTU. Tangentially, I love to read 
popular and acedemic works of classical and modern Marxist scholars through our Marxist Reading Group (and of course, on my own time as well).
I also enjoy hiking on trips back to my home state of Utah, posting everything I see to my Instagram Story, cooking new meals in my
toaster oven, and reading science-fiction works by anarchists, and playing video games on my Switch with my friends, along with many hobbies that I start and stop periodically.
