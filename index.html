I'm a political and moral psychologist interested in the anaylsis and elaboration violence as a liberatory force in marganizled populations; 
along with the intersection of mass social movements and radical political ideologies. I'm currently working on my senior thesis at Illinois
State Univeristy, where I am studying the relationship between college students' actual knowledge of a wide spectrum political orietentions and 
their confidence and accuracy in identifying them. By understanding the relationship between these two variables, I hope to devlop a better 
understanding of policy communitcation as well as providing insight into a rapidly growing and changing younger voting population. An increased 
understanding here could provide an explanation to the factors that contrubute to an increasing level of reactionary politics and its potential 
effects on hindering social justice movements in the United States and abroad.

I hold an A.S. in Psychology from College of Lake County, and I plan to graduate with a B.S. in Psychology from Illinois State University in May 
2025.
